## Notes

- We encountered a theme issue due to AppCompat, which we resolved by updating the app theme in `themes.xml`.
- TMDB API integration went smoothly once we configured our base URL and model structure.
- Custom styling was added using imported Google Fonts to give the app a distinct, cinematic vibe.
- We are still working on implementing search functionality and plan to add it before the final demo.
